*Landing Pad Remote Access* allows players to connect to and interact with the inventory of *Cargo Landing Pad* from afar. Unlike *Cargo Bays*, *Landing Pad Remote Accesses* no longer need to physically attach to the main *Cargo Landing Pad*, provinding easy access to the *Cargo Landing Pad* from any position on the surface where a *Landing Pad Remote Access* is present.

---

# How it works

- Build a *Landing Pad Remote Access* anywhere on the map, it will automatically autolink to the surface's *Cargo Landing Pad*.
- No performance impact: the *Landing Pad Remote Access* is natively supported by the engine, so special script is needed to run it.
